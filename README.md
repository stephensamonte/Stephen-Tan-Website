# Website-Stephen-Tan
This is my personal website. This is where I show case projects I have or am working on. 

URL to deployed website: https://stephen-tan-website.firebaseapp.com/

# Notes
- This website isn't perfect. There's only so much one person can do. Early on I opted to use a template as a base so that I don't have to waste so much time making it look good for different devices.
- I do not have a custom domain URL because $12 a year is a cost that is not necessary. I think that having firebaseapp in the url tells people that I use Firebase for people familiar with their services. Also I expect most people to find this link via clicking on my electronic resume or social media sites (Github & LinkedIn). 

# Environment
